            <p>(1) Salvor Integration into the Response Organization</p>
            <p>The size and complexity of a salvage operation will dictate the configuration of the Incident Command
                organization formed under the Unified Command</p>

            <p>Salvage response can range from simple to complex. Four variables to be considered in organizing for a
                salvage response are:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Size of the incident</li>
                <li>Complexity of the incident response, and</li>
                <li>Relative significance of salvage operations with respect to other aspects of the response</li>
                <li>Public firefighting resource coordination</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This section is intended to address the coordination between the differing response organizations <b>before</b>
                an incident occurs. It entails inter-organizational outreach, participation in the ACP process, and
                communication between the planholders, resource providers, and other affected port partners. Donjon-SMIT
                considers it important to ensure that all the pre-incident coordination is in place prior to an
                emergency situation. <b>We acknowledge, however, that the Incident Commander/Unified Command will be
                    responsible for coordination activities after an incident occurs and during all phases of the
                    incident response.</b></p>

            <p>Coordination with other resources, organizations and OSROs includes pre-incident inter-organizational
                outreach, and communication between the planholders, resource providers, and other affected port
                partners. Participation in the ACP process is an important part of this planning. Pre-incident
                coordination with firefighting resources that are public assets is completed through local maritime
                firefighting groups and individual coordination with each of the municipal departments.</p>

            <p><b>How Donjon-SMIT assessment personnel coordinate response activity with oil spill removal
                    organizations.</b></p>
            <p>Salvage and firefighting integration into the ICS is an important element of any response, particularly
                when these elements of the response are predominant or are critical. Since the Salvage Master or his
                representative is often the most knowledgeable person in the response organization, the access of that
                person to the Incident Command/Unified Command is important. Coordination and response organization
                dynamics are always changing, but utilizing the unified command structure with salvage and firefighting
                efforts appropriately interjected at a high enough level to ensure that dissemination of information
                required for correct decision-making will ensure success.</p>

            <p>Salvage Masters and their command center representatives have the most intimate knowledge of a vessel
                casualty. Historically, the salvors and marine firefighters have been placed in the Operations Section,
                however room must be made, at the prerogative of the Incident Commander/Unified Command, to structure
                the ICS organization to best fit the incident's needs. At the onset of an incident, Donjon-SMIT will
                rapidly interface with the Operations Section Chief and the Unified Command to ensure the correct
                placement of the salvage team within the ICS organization.</p>

            <p>Scenarios 1 through 4 below, illustrated by Figures 1 through 4, are examples of the organization of
                salvage response efforts within an ICS structure. The Scenario 1 organization depicted in Figure 1 is
                for a response that involves only limited salvage operations while Scenario 3, illustrated by Figure 3,
                is an example of organizing for an extremely complex salvage incident. Scenario 4 shows specific public
                firefighting resource coordination.</p>

            <p>(1) <u><b>Scenario 1:</b></u> Vessel casualties that require only limited salvage operations before the
                vessel can be delivered safely may be managed successfully from within the standard ICS structure, with
                the Operations Section Chief establishing a Salvage Group and placing a experienced salvor in Operations
                as a technical specialist.</p>

            <p>Figure 1 below illustrates an ICS structure with limited salvage operational elements.</p>
            <div class="figure-reference">Figure&nbsp;</div>
            <img src="{{ public_path('images/nt-smff-annex-fig1.jpg') }}" style="width:4.42in; height:3.4in;"/>
            <div class="figure-title">
                Figure 1: For response operations that require minimal salvage operations the Operations Section Chief
                may establish a Salvage Group with support from a Salvage Technical Specialist.
            </div>

            <p>(2) <u><b>Scenario 2:</b></u> If the incident is more complex and salvage operations are a primary focus
                of the response, the Operations Section Chief may establish a &ldquo;Salvage Branch&rdquo; to oversee
                the activities of the Salvage Group and facilitate critical discussions between the salvor and the
                Unified Command. Figure 2 illustrates how the Operations Section Chief may organize to manage an
                incident where salvage operations are undertaken concurrently with pollution removal operations.
                Depending on the incident, this may demand a high degree of coordination, managed by the Operations
                Section Chief, to minimize environmental damage.</p>
            <div class="figure-reference">Figure&nbsp;</div>
            <img src="{{ public_path('images/nt-smff-annex-fig2.jpg') }}" style="width:4.42in; height:3.07in;"/>
            <div class="figure-title">
                Figure 2: For more complex salvage operations the Operations Section Chief may organize using a Salvage
                Branch to manage salvage operations and a Pollution Removal Branch to manage clean up and recovery
                operations.
            </div>
            <p>(3) <u><b>Scenario 3:</b></u> There are incidents involving salvage operations and pollution removal
                operations of such complexity that significant management problems are generated. When complex salvage
                operation becomes necessary, the Salvor needs the freedom to communicate rapidly and directly with the
                Unified Command. To facilitate the management of these types of incidents a second Operations Section
                Chief can be added to the traditional ICS structure. Under this scenario, the Unified Command assumes
                direct responsibility for coordination of response efforts. Figure 3 illustrates the use of a second
                Operations Section Chief.</p>
            <p>As soon as circumstances of the incident permit, a reevaluation of the need for two distinct Operations
                Section Chiefs should be conducted, and, when practicable, the organization should return to a standard
                ICS organization with one Operations Section Chief.</p>

            <p>(4) <u><b>Scenario 4:</b></u> Coordination and Response with Public Fire Departments</p>
            <p>Section 8000 of the Area Contingency Plans Base Plan, &ldquo;Marine Firefighting Executive Summary&rdquo;
                states:</p>
            <p>&ldquo;8120 Regional and Local Policy</p>
            <p>Whether there is a vessel fire or shore side fire at a waterfront facility, or if there is a fire aboard
                a vessel that is underway anywhere within the COTP's &hellip; Area of Responsibility (AOR), primary
                responsibility for firefighting lies with the municipality in whose jurisdiction the facility/vessel
                lies. The municipal fire department in whose jurisdiction the fire lies will be the Incident Commander
                (IC) for the firefighting activities. The IC is responsible for the coordination of all fire fighting
                activities. Assistance may, and in most cases will, be provided by other municipal fire departments via
                mutual aid agreements.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Clearly, as part of the ACP, the local fire department is (properly) expected to be the Incident
                Commander and to decide when/if and how any private resources are integrated into the response
                organization. As a private response provider and holder of the vessel pre-fire plans, Donjon-SMIT meets
                with and discusses procedures with the municipal firefighting organization and potential Incident
                Commander for the locations covered under this plan.</p>
            <p>It is always Donjon-SMIT's policy to defer to the local municipality as IC, and Donjon-SMIT will assume
                responsibility (in terms of IC) only with local IC/fire department concurrence. The best value-added
                assistance from Donjon-SMIT will be the sharing of marine firefighting expertise and specifics and the
                provision of specialized marine firefighting equipment (such as inert gas generators).</p>
            <p>While each municipality is a little different, they all follow the tenets of the National Incident
                Management System and that is the crux of our coordination. We will operate wholly within that system as
                well.</p>
            <p>Similarly, any firefighting providers will be working for/with Donjon-SMIT and as such will be directly
                integrated into any local UCS/ICS. They will NOT be operating independently.</p>
            <p>Coordination between the differing response organizations and Donjon-SMIT includes pre-incident planning
                that entails inter-organizational outreach, participation in the ACP process, and communication between
                the planholders, resource providers, and other affected port partners. It is vital to ensure that all
                the pre-incident coordination is in place prior to an emergency situation.</p>
            <p>Finally, for each municipality for which we are relying on initial support, we will share pre-fire plans
                so that they can be reviewed and agreed upon prior to an incident.</p>
            <p class="list-section">c. <span>(2)</span> Firefighting Integration into the Response Organization</p>
            <p>The size and complexity of a firefighting operation will dictate the configuration of the Incident
                Command organization formed under the Unified Command.</p>

            <p>Typical responsibilities of the first fire responder on-scene include:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Assume position as the lead in the Unified Command for marine firefighting operations if the vessel
                    on fire is moored to a shore side facility or if the vessel is underway when the fire occurs and the
                    master/crew cannot extinguish the fire without assistance.
                </li>
                <li>Establish and staff the Unified Command Post.</li>
                <li>Dispatch necessary personnel and equipment.</li>
                <li>Determine the need for and request mutual aid, such as on-scene initial assessment, equipment
                    support, fireboats and appropriate medical aid.
                </li>
                <li>If working with a municipal fire department, support the On-Scene Incident Commander (generally the
                    local fire chief) and provide maritime firefighting expertise and advice. Generally Donjon-SMIT will
                    assume control of the incident only when relinquished by the local fire chief. DJS will work within
                    the Unified Command to coordinate all other aspects of the response, including waterside security,
                    landside traffic and crowd control, scene security, and evacuation.
                </li>
                <li>Provide portable communications equipment to response personnel from outside agencies.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Variables to be considered in organizing for a Firefighting response are: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Size of the incident</li>
                <li>Complexity of the incident response, and</li>
                <li>Relative significance of firefighting operations with respect to other aspects of the response</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="">The Scenario below, illustrated by Figure 4, is an example of the organization of Firefighting
                response within the Operations Section, relative to Salvage and Pollution Removal efforts under the ICS
                structure.</p>
            <div class="figure-reference">Figure&nbsp;</div>
            <img src="{{ public_path('images/nt-smff-annex-fig4.jpg') }}" style="width:4.42in; height:2.74in;"/>
            <div class="figure-title">
                Figure 4: When the Firefighting Branch is activated, it is within the Branch level of the Operations
                Section. The Firefighting Branch Director is primarily responsible for implementing strategic aspects of
                waterborne and shore side firefighting efforts.

            <p>Coordination with other response resource providers, response organizations and OSRO's</p>
            <p>Salvage and Marine Firefighting resource providers will coordinate with other response resources,
                response organizations, and OSRO's within the ICS structure under the direction of the Operations Chief
                except in major complex incidents, in which case a separate Salvage Operations section and/or separate
                Firefighting Operations section may be established, reporting directly to the Unified Command.</p>
            <p>Pre-incident coordination will be achieved through regular participation in QI exercises and seminars;
                coordination with spill management teams; regular meetings with COTP Zone personnel and local public
                firefighting resources to establish protocols, ensure familiarity with Salvor/Firefighter capabilities,
                and to establish methods for seamless integration into the ICS structure under the Unified Command; and
                participation in industry spill management seminars and events enhancing effective spill response
                management skills.</p>
